            <h3>Cai Rang Floating Market</h3>
            <p>Cai Rang floating market is one of the three biggest floating markets in the Mekong Delta. The market is
                open all day but it is busiest from sunrise to about 9 am. The main items sold there are farm products
                and
                specialties of Cai Rang Town, Chau Thanh District and neighboring areas. Every boat has a long upright
                pole
                at its bow on which samples of the goods for sale are hung. The waterway becomes a maze of hundreds of
                boats
                packed with mango, bananas, papaya, pineapple, and even smuggled goods like cigarettes. Sellers tie
                their
                goods to a tall pole so that buyers can see from a distance what they are selling.</p>
